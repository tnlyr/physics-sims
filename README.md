## Introduction

Our physics simulation project is a versatile and interactive tool designed with Java and JavaFX to explore fundamental concepts in physics, including projectile motion, optics, and pendulum dynamics. It provides a hands-on learning experience, making complex physics principles accessible and engaging.

## Features

List the main features of your simulation:

- **Projectile Motion Simulation, [by Lounes](https://github.com/tnlyr):**  In the realm of Newtonian Mechanics, students embark on an exploration of projectile motion. Projectile motion is defined as the motion experienced by an object or particle that is launched within a gravitational field, such as from the Earth's surface. In this type of motion, the object follows a curved path solely influenced by the force of gravity. The trajectory of the object is uniquely determined by various factors, including its initial velocity, initial position, launch angle, and mass. Precise calculations and predictions regarding the object's path can be achieved by employing the four kinematics formulas. These formulas serve as indispensable tools in analyzing and understanding the intricate dynamics of projectile motion.

- **Optics Simulation, [by Rami](https://github.com/RamiElBeaino):** In the study of physics optics, students often investigate the realm of lenses and their influence on the behaviour of light rays. Specifically, they encounter two types of lenses: concave and convex lenses. These lenses possess distinct characteristics that alter the path of light rays. Concave lenses cause rays to diverge after interacting with them, earning them the name "diverging lenses." On the other hand, convex lenses lead to the convergence of rays, earning them the title of "converging lenses."The nature of the images produced by these lenses depends on the relative size of the lens itself. These images can be classified as either real or virtual. To calculate the image distance using the lens formula, both the object distance and the lens focal length must be considered. This ensures accurate analysis and understanding of the optical system at hand. The optics formula serves as a crucial tool in establishing the connection between the object's distance (o), the focal length of the lens (f), and the distance at which the image is formed by the rays emanating from the object. Moreover, this distance between the object and the image provides valuable insights into determining whether the resulting image is real or virtual. Additionally, lens-induced magnification can be deduced by analyzing these distances' relationships. By using this formula, students can better understand the complexities of optics and how light behaves with lenses, allowing them to explore the intricacies of this field and develop a deeper comprehension.

- **Pendulum Simulation, [by Shoaib](https://github.com/Shtrust):**  The concept of the program is to allow the user to choose different parameters such as mass, length, angle, and gravity and then observe what the differences that happen because of those changes in parameters in the simulation are. It is an Educational Tool: A pendulum simulation can be an excellent educational tool to help students understand the fundamental principles of physics, such as oscillation, gravity, and harmonic motion. Through a visual representation of a swinging pendulum, students can observe the relationships between variables like length, mass, and amplitude and how they affect the pendulum's behaviour. It provides a hands-on experience and reinforces theoretical concepts in a more engaging manner. Also, it allows for the Visualization of Physical Phenomena: JavaFX pendulum animations can visually demonstrate various physical phenomena related to pendulums, such as the concept of period and frequency. Viewers can observe changes in the pendulum's motion by manipulating parameters like length or amplitude, helping them understand the relationship between different variables. This visual representation enhances comprehension and retention of complex concepts.
